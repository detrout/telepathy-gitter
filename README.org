* Introduction

One of my colaborators wants to use gitter for managing
all of her groups, I'd rather have a something that
integrates with my local IM system, so an attempt and
connecting to gitter.

I may not ever actually implement useful things like
authentication. My target is to connect to a room, see
whats in it and send messages.
